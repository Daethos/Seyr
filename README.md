# **[Seyr of Daethos][A First Place]**
<br />

## Greetings, weary traveler, it is myself, Mirio, a kindly merchant traveling from Lor, here to showcase an exciting app granting many mysteries. I'm sure your [constant gameplay][don't look] elsewhere has left you bereft of hope, shambling for some semblance of salvation. Well, fear no more !! Just released of my [own free will][best not look], this may yet help you better enjoy a game with dynamic yet simple combat mechanics against computers and players alike. This application will allow you to journey into this world as one of several definable race-cultures--crafting your character to your personal quirks, seeing how one may better resource concepts and pair synergistic equipment pieces together for great forms of **_attack_** and **_defense_**! Let us venture into this sorcery the likes this daethic worshiper of the One Above believes somewhat blasphemous but for the purposes of this sale I'll allow it.

    <summary>Character Creation</summary>

## From Here, we're asked to create a character if you are not in possession of one--which at the beginning, of course not! You may be yourself, but who are you, really? And now we can settle on the matter of what you believe it is best to wear to a sudden and proper death in front of an adoring crowd, of course we are antiquitous in nature, and are not prone toward bothering to cheer for anyone but the proper favorites, of which you cannot hope to be--not yet, that is!

    <summary>Story Mode</summary>

## Well look at you, I cannot attest for that cursed and maddening weapon you've chosen, but the beautiful attire you've selected to wear to battle is a sight to behold, it reminds me of our standard issue Licivitan equipment for soldiers, though the Daethic Knights tend to look a bit too Northren--yet I am a worldy man of course, and see no issue in such matters. Hopefully here it is where you prove yourself before venturing to thwart more active and dynamic opponents.
